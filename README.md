# *CS 25-322 AI Generated Planning Insights Powered by Clickstream Data*
Problem Statement: As a platform stakeholder, how can I leverage clickstream data to provide observations/recommendations in roadmap planning?
## *Project Sponsor*
Capital One
## *Project Description*

Acceptance criteria for the project includes: 
1. Creating a basic web application with clickstream enabled. This will give us the opportunity to work with a new coding language and better understand Clickstream.
2. Creating an AI powered solution, trained using clickstream data, that will provide roadmap/planning recommendations. It will accurately handle prompts such as “How can I reduce AHT in the X container?”, “Where do users spend the most time in the application?”, “What are my critical features?”.
4. Can be narrowed to a specific container/component or application-wide.
5. Integrating with JIRA to create mock Epics/stories, if the recommendation is accepted.

We will have access to existing AI implementations, JIRA access, and access to clickstream storage. 
   
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.
