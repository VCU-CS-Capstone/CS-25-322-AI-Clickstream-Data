## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Continued to work on front-end for website prototype

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Research more into connecting the front-end and the back-end
   - Look into a way to generate large quantities of quality clickstream data for the AI to learn from
